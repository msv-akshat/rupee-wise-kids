# RupeeWise Kids 💰 – Financial Literacy Prototype App

⚠️ **Note:** This project was created as a **learning experiment during my second year**, using low-code/no-code tools like **Lovable AI** to explore React layouts and early UI design.  
It is not actively maintained and serves as an archived prototype.

## 🧒 About the App

**RupeeWise Kids** is a prototype app aimed at teaching children the basics of money, saving, and budgeting in a simple, interactive way.

The idea was to build a web-based experience where young users could:
- Learn how to **save and spend wisely**
- Understand basic **budgeting principles**
- Interact with **visually appealing lessons and stories**
- Engage with planned quizzes and games (future scope)

This project helped me understand how to translate educational content into a user-friendly digital product.
